One-upmanship is everything to you.
Put that one-upmanship up inside me
Push it hard, as hard as you can
Put your faith in me,
by that I mean fuck me with it
I agree, I'm beneath you
You're cleaner, more pure
You have faith, put that faith up there
That one-upmanship, pound it pound it
make me know, make me feel it
I'm less than you
I'm less than you
I'm less than you
I don't get it yet
You have to push it
harder, further, pound it,
push it out of my mouth,
make me say it, make me say what you want
You tell me what to do,
but I don't get it right
becuase I'm too stupid
make me feel how stupid I am
I want you to push that thing
further, harder, faster, please,
please, and choke me
you have to choke me, please choke me,
choke me harder because I want to die
I let people take advantage of me
and walk all over me
Make me feel stupid, push what you
think of me into me
You're younger, more engaged, smarter
faster, stronger
My ideas aren't as good
you got a firm grip on everything
and I'm slipping, I am slipping,
it's out of my hands
I'm clutsy, it's falling
out of my hands,
I'm falling, I'm going to hit the
ground fast, hard, harder than you
and I'm going to break apart
And I want you to make me see that
and feel that, make it my reality,
push it up there,
You can't tell anyone, though
Don't tell anyone
No one can know
I can't associate with you
I can't be in your world
I'm not good enough
We both know that
That's why you're fucking me
in a secret place that's
far away from your perfection
from your perfect life
things you tell your parents
you tell your relatives about
how well you're doing and
everything's great
Couldn't possibly put
me in that picture
I'm not in that picture
I'm filthy, beneath you
Below you in every way
I'm not as pristine, clean
Nice-looking,
I'm just too old, stupid,
awkward
Step over me, step on me,
put that foot up there,
Punch it, punch it
harder harder harder
I don't want to see
I want to be unconscious
Just make me unconscious
Then pound the life out me, please
Just pound the life out of me
